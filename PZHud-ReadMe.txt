PZHUD A17 (b240)
Moves, resizes, and adds some elements to the UI of the game as well as adding a third forge input.
Just extract the PZHud folder to your mods folder.
I cannot guarantee this will work with any other modlets/mods that make changes to XUi folder files.
Thanks to Steadman420 for the use of some of his UI elements. The buff indicators in the lower left are largely his work. The forge input is all him.
